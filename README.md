# NoteCards

This is my computer science project. It's basically just a note-taking app with flashcard functionalities. Once you've tried it, would you mind filling out this survey: https://forms.office.com/r/pgEH0HRJGE? Thanks! Also, if you find any bugs let me know.

Also I just realised, Kivy is an annoying piece of software to handle. You'll have to download it to run the code, for which the instructions are here: https://kivy.org/doc/stable/gettingstarted/installation.html. It's a cool piece of software though, and if you download it, running kivy-examples/3Drendering/main.py displays a 3D monkey.
